# Sudoku Solver

Simply put- solve a sudoku puzzle in seconds regardless of difficulty

# How?
• Run Solver.py

• Input every single number on the board, row by row

• If the position is empty (void of any number), enter 0

• The program will output a completed board once all values are entered


# #Todo
• Implement an automatic input feature for board values

• (Online game only) Implement an automatic playing feature, so the user only needs to input values on the board and the
program will automatically fill out the game board
